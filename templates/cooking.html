<p>I call this my any-time spaghetti sauce. It's easy. Unfussy. You can make it any night of the week.</p>
<p>And it takes just a few staple ingredients most of us have on hand: canned tomatoes, onions, garlic, and carrots, plus a couple spices and fresh herbs for flavor. It's perfect for serving with simple boiled pasta, for layering <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/zucchini-parmesan/">zucchini parmesan</a> and <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/manicotti-cheese-stuffed-pasta/">Manicotti (3-cheese stuffed pasta)</a> with saucy goodness, or as a dipping sauce for appetizers like <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/arancini/">arancini (Italian fried risotto)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Savvy Italian nonnas don't necessarily wait for tomato season to conjure up the perfect homemade spaghetti sauce or marinara sauce, and neither should we.&nbsp; Quality canned tomatoes from the pantry will do the trick just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many pasta sauce recipes call for 3 to 4 different kinds of canned tomatoes, I found that crushed canned tomatoes provide the perfect consistency for this tomato sauce. Simpler the better!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You'll love this homemade spaghetti sauce recipe. Just the right thickness and so much flavor. So let's get to it!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
<p>This homemade spaghetti sauce recipe takes a few ingredients you may already have on hand. Here's what you'll need and how to prep for this recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extra virgin olive oil</strong>- I used <a href="https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/private-reserve-extra-virgin-olive-oil/">Private Reserve</a> Greek extra virgin olive oil. The chopped veggies/aromatics are sauteed in this EVOO to start the sauce (some use a bit of butter in addition, if you're looking for something a bit more fatty or rich).</li>
<li><strong>Onions</strong>- 1 medium sized onion, I used a yellow onion here. It's a good idea to chop the onions as small as you can get them so they're not too chunky.</li>
<li><strong>Garlic</strong>- Can't have a good Italian tomato sauce without a bit of fresh garlic. About 3 to 4 garlic cloves, minced.</li>
<li><strong>Carrots-</strong> While carrots are not a traditional ingredient for spaghetti sauce or pasta sauce, they are the secret ingredient here that helps thicken the tomato sauce while also adding natural sweetness. I use 2 carrots (smaller carrots are okay to use). Be sure to finely grate the carrots using a small food processor or a grater (I tried both and I liked the results using the food processor better).</li>
<li><strong>Canned Tomatoes-</strong> I use a large 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes here. No need for different kinds of tomato sauce or canned tomatoes, but if you want to add a spoon for tomato paste in addition, that won't hurt.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Seasoning-</strong> A good bit of dried oregano and pinch of <a href="https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/sweet-spanish-paprika/">sweet paprika</a> make a simpler Italian seasoning that works really well here. If you like a little heat to your sauce, add a pinch for crushed red pepper flakes.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fresh herbs-</strong> Torn basil and chopped fresh parsley complete the Italian flavors for this marinara pasta sauce. You can play with the amounts of fresh herbs to your liking, but a good place to start is about
 cup packed of each.</li>
</ul>

<p>A meatless pasta sauce is super versatile, that's why I make it more often. But it's easy to turn this into a hearty spaghetti meat sauce with very little effort.</p>
<p>You'll need about 1 lb of ground meat of your choices (ground beef, chicken, turkey, or Italian sauce).</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-follow-these-steps-to-make-this-sauce-with-meat"><strong>Follow these steps to make this sauce with meat:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Heat a little bit of extra virgin olive oil. Add in your ground meat and cook over medium heat, tossing regularly, until fully browned. Drain the meat and transfer to a plate for now.</li>
<li>In the same braiser or pot, saute the onions, garlic and carrots for 5 minutes in a little bit of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
<li>Add the cooked ground meat back to the pot, and toss to combine.</li>
<li>Add the tomatoes, water, and season per recipe. Bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Turn heat down and let the sauce simmer for about 20 more minutes. Check occasionally and add a bit of water (or your pasta cooking water), if you need to.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-thicken-spaghetti-sauce"><strong>How to thicken spaghetti sauce?</strong></h2>
<p>Why is this homemade spaghetti sauce rich and just the right thickness even though it is meatless? Here are a few things that make a difference:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add finely chopped or grated vegetables</strong>. This is another great reason why I love adding finely grated carrots. Not only do they add natural sweetness to the tomato sauce, but they also thicken the sauce and give it a nice body.</li>
<li><strong>Use the right kind of canned tomatoes.</strong> Many recipes will use tomato sauce. That's fine, but if you're after thicker consistency, canned crushed tomatoes will give you a better result. And like I said earlier, something I don't always add is a couple tablespoons of tomato paste which could also help.</li>
<li><strong>Do not add too much liquid.</strong> In this recipe, I use about
 cup water earlier on to get things going. Later, I watch the sauce as it simmers and I add a little bit more if needed (great use for pasta cooking water if you have it ready, the starch from the pasta cooking water will also help).</li>
<li><strong>Simmer the sauce. </strong>You'll notice that once the sauce boils briefly, I turn the heat down and let it simmer a good 20 minutes. If I'm not in a hurry, I leave it a few extra minutes, watching the consistency and adding liquid if it turns too thick.</li>
<li><strong>Other ways to thicken the sauce</strong>. Not used in this recipe, but you can also use a little bit of corn starch or even add an egg to thicken the sauce (egg must be tempered before adding). I don't use either of these methods in my recipe because it is just the right thickness for me.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-long-does-pasta-sauce-last-in-the-fridge"><strong>How long does pasta sauce last in the fridge?</strong></h2>
<p>This vegetarian spaghetti sauce will keep well in the fridge for 3 to 4 days.</p>
<p>First, be sure the sauce is fully cooled. Transfer to a tight-lid glass container or glass jar to refrigerate. If you've tossed it with spaghetti, try turning your leftovers into <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/spaghetti-pie/">spaghetti pie</a>! </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-you-freeze-spaghetti-sauce-nbsp"><strong>Can you freeze spaghetti sauce?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>I often make a few batches of this spaghetti sauce to keep in the freezer for later use.</p>
<p>To freeze pasta sauce, again be sure it is cooled completely. Transfer to freezer-safe containers, leaving enough room for the sauce to expand as it freezes. Cover tightly and be sure to label the container clearly with content and date.</p>
<p>Thaw the sauce in the fridge overnight. Warm up over medium heat, stirring as needed.</p>
